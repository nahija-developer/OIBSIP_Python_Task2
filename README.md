# OIBSIP_Python_Task2
 Project Title: AI Voice Assistant

ðŸ“– Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a simple Python-based voice assistant that responds to voice commands. This project helps in understanding speech recognition, text-to-speech conversion, and automation using Python.

ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies Used

Python (Core concepts)

speech_recognition

pyttsx3

datetime, webbrowser, pyjokes, os

VS Code / PyCharm (IDE)

ðŸš€ Steps Performed

Defined the functionality and basic voice commands.

Used speech recognition to capture and process user voice input.

Used text-to-speech (pyttsx3) for assistant responses.

Integrated modules for tasks like opening websites, telling time, jokes, etc.

Tested the assistant for different voice inputs and improved accuracy.

âœ… Outcome
The project successfully demonstrates how Python can be used to build a basic AI voice assistant. It improved my understanding of voice-based interaction, real-time processing, and modular coding.
